# iphoto-cleanup
A Lightroom plugin for use after importing from an iPhoto library. Converts all Event collection sets into collections.

Specifically, this plugin finds every collection set with a single child collection named "Event Photos" and converts it into a collection (with the same constituent photos as its former child)
